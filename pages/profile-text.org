** Privacy level

   You can control your visibility on this site; please select a
   level.  On the whole, your name will appear less than it did when
   we were using the wiki and meetup.com.

   Your visibility will be different for the public (non-logged-in
   users), logged-in members in general, and in contexts in which your
   name is specifically relevant.

   - ( ) Shameless self-publicist / keen networker

     Your name will appear on public sections of the site, including
     being listed as signed up for events.  This is similar to the
     privacy level provided by the old system of meetup.com and the
     wiki, i.e. none.

   - ( ) Open

     Your name will appear publicly only as the host of events you are
     hosting.  It will be visible as signed up for events only to
     logged-in users.

     Also, for equipment that can display the name of the current user
     (typically 3-D printers), your name will appear on the
     equipment's display while you're using the equipment.

   - ( ) Shy and retiring

     Your name will not appear on publicly-visible pages, nor for
     logged-in users in general, except as an event host or an
     equipment owner or trainer.  However, event hosts will be able to
     see your name on the list of people who have signed up for an
     event, and equipment owners and trainers will be able to see on
     the lists of users, owners and trainers for their equipment
     types.

     For equipment that can display the name of the current user, your
     name will appear on the display while you're using it.
     
   - ( ) Anonymous

     Your name will not be visible except to yourself and to the
     database admins; in other contexts, it will be replaced by your
     membership number.

     This is probably not very good for community-building, so we hope
     it won't be used unnecessarily, but we've made it available just
     in case.

     For equipment that can display the name of the current user, your
     membership number will appear on the display while you're using it.

   Please note that all profile information is visible to the database
   admins and auditors (read-only admins); they can't really do their
   tasks without it.

** Interest and skill areas

   Knowing your interest areas is useful both for planning and for
   outreach.  Like the general demographic information, we're
   interested to know, but if you think it's none of our business,
   please feel welcome to skip it.

   For each area, there are four levels you can select:

   0. Not interested.

   1. I would like to learn about / be trained in this.

   2. I am already doing this.

   3. I am confident to help teach / train others in this.

   We can also use this information to mail you when events tagged with
   these areas are created:

   [ ] Please contact me about training in my level 1 areas.

   [ ] Please contact me about general events in my level 2 areas.
   
   [ ] Please contact me if looking for people to talk in my level 3 areas.

** Meeting requirements and preferences

   For events for which catering is provided, if people tell us what
   they don't eat, we can make sure we include suitable proportions of
   non-default foods (yes, usually pizza).  This information will only
   be shown to event hosts, and only anonymously (the hosts' view of
   the event page will include show how many of each requirement
   combination there are).  Of course, database admins can see the
   information; they can see all information.

   We would like to gather some demographic information, to help to

   information in aggregate form only.  Please feel welcome to leave
   this unanswered if you don't think it's any of our business.

   - education: school / tech college / uni degree / masters /
     doctorate
