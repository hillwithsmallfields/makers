* Makespace database help
** Introduction

   This is the membership, equipment and training database for
   Makespace, a hackerspace in Cambridge, UK.

   It holds the following information:

   - the list of members
   - the list of equipment types
   - [the list of equipment instances --- not yet]
   - the list of events held at Makespace

   Through this system, you can:

   - maintain your user profile
   - check your training status for equipment
   - request training on equipment
   - schedule events
   - [check equipment status -- not yet]

   Makespace members are likely to be the type of people who like to
   form a good mental model of how something works, so we'll go
   straight in with the real key to understanding the system: it is
   centred around ``events'', of which the most important is
   training.  The system manages people's permissions to do things
   (such as use particular equipment), and those permissions are
   represented by having successfully attended events which grant
   those permissions (i.e. training).
