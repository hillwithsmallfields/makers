   training event results are partly working; the people show up as
   trained in the list of people trained on the equipment, but the
   equipment doesn't show up in the list of the equipment the people
   are trained on.

   It turned out that the people's lists were correct, as the event
   was still in the future, and so was being ignored; the equipments'
   lists need fixing.

* Testing
  - change and save some profile and control fields
  - use admin's list of people to enter training requests on behalf of
    various users, for an equipment type for which you are a trainer
  - as yourself, schedule a training event in the very near future
    (maybe about 10 minutes ahead)
  - look at the other users' dashboards, look in their notifications,
    respond to the invitations
  - go to the training event page, refresh it to see the users on it,
    mark them as having passed
  - check that the equipment type is now shown on the list of types
    that each of those users can use
  - check that those users are listed on the equipment type page as
    users of that equipment type
