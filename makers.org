   training event results are partly working; the people show up as
   trained in the list of people trained on the equipment, but the
   equipment doesn't show up in the list of the equipment the people
   are trained on.

   It turned out that the people's lists were correct, as the event
   was still in the future, and so was being ignored; the equipments'
   lists need fixing.
** TODO event template editor
** TODO fix notifications and announcements
