* Testing
  - change and save some profile and control fields
  - use admin's list of people to enter training requests on behalf of
    various users, for an equipment type for which you are a trainer
  - as yourself, schedule a training event in the very near future
    (maybe about 10 minutes ahead)
  - look at the other users' dashboards, look in their notifications,
    respond to the invitations
  - go to the training event page, refresh it to see the users on it,
    mark them as having passed
  - check that the equipment type is now shown on the list of types
    that each of those users can use
  - check that those users are listed on the equipment type page as
    users of that equipment type
