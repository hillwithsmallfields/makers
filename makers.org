   training event results are partly working; the people show up as
   trained in the list of people trained on the equipment, but the
   equipment doesn't show up in the list of the equipment the people
   are trained on.

   It turned out that the people's lists were correct, as the event
   was still in the future, and so was being ignored; the equipments'
   lists need fixing.
** TODO lists of people with training on equipment to take note of the training date
   and not count people as qualified when their qualification date is
   still in the future
** TODO switch to https
** TODO training success to cancel training requests
** TODO validate choice of stylesheet
** TODO fix "mark all as read" in notifications and announcements
