<p>The duplicates list has a section for each group of profiles that
have the same name.  Each of the profiles in the group is given as the
profile (shown <span class="identifying">like this</span>) and the
operational data (shown <span class="operational">like this</span>.)
You should sort out which is the real one (typically the longest one
in the group) and delete the others from the collections by their
link-ids.</p>
