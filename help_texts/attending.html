<p>If you have signed up for a training event, please do be sure to
attend, or to let us know that you can't make it.  Just not turning up
wastes a training slot, and training slots are usually a limiting
resource.</p>

<p>The system records no-shows, and if you do it more than a set
number of times (currently 2) it will block you from signing up for
more training, until you have seen one of the management team to
explain and to give convincing assurance that you won't do it
again.</p>
