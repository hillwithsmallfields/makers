<p>If you have signed up for a training event, please do be sure to
attend, or to <a href="mailto:admin@makespace.org">let us know</a>
that you can't make it.  Just not turning up wastes a training slot,
and training slots are usually a limiting resource.</p>

<p>The system records no-shows, and if you do it more than a set
number of times (currently 2) it will block you from signing up for
more training, until you have <a href="mailto:admin@makespace.org">seen one of the management team</a>
to explain and to give convincing assurance that you won't do it
again.</p>
