<p>As your relationship with equipment types is defined by you having
completed the relevent training event, in the context of training
"host" means the trainer and "attendee" the person being trained.  If
you're hosting an event / training people, it would be helpful for
your name to be visible to attendees / trainees, unless you are
extremely concerned for your privacy.  Likewise, but not quite as

who will be attending the events.</p>
