<p>Adding a user using "Add user" button will automatically send them
a password reset email, and then display the form again to add another
user.</p>

<p>Importing users from a CSV file only makes the mongodb entries for
them, and doesn't create a django user that can log in (the importer
is run outside the django environment).  For the latter, you should
use the "Update django logins" button.  This will check all mongodb
user entries for missing django user entries, and create the missing
entries, and send them passowrd reset emails.</p>
