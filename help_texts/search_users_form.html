<p>Dates should be entered in the usual <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO-8601</a> format:
yyyy-mm-dd.</p>

<p>The name search is a <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html">regexp search</a> on
the full name.</p>

<p>Users without link-ids are not able to log into the system, as any
identity they have in the django part of the system will not be
connected to their identity in the main makers system.  This can
generally be fixed by giving them a new login name in their
profile.</p>

<p>It is probably valid for users not to have an email address set,
but they will only be able to see notifications of training sessions
they've expressed an interest in by logging in to the site and looking
at their notifications tab.  However, it is probably usually a data
error, perhaps missing data in an imported dataset.</p>

<p>"Include non-members" will include users on the system who have
left or been banned, and those who have not completed joining.  If
this is not checked, only current members will be shown.</p>

<p>Later on, there may be options for searching for users who haven't
made the most recent due membership subscription payment, or who
haven't accessed the makers system, or used the door system, since a
given date, but makers doesn't yet connect to the payment and door
systems.</p>
