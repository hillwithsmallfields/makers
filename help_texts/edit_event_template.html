<p>This is the event template editor.  You can add, remove, and alter
fields.</p>

<p>Until this is documented properly, you may have to look at the code
to understand the meaning of each field.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new template, start to edit the most
similar existing template, and save it under a new name.</p>
