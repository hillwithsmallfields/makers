  <dt> Notifications </dt>

  <dd> <p>are sent by the system as an effect of an action, rather
      than being sent in their own right by a person (they are not an
      internal email system between people).  Their main use is to let
      you know when training becomes available for an equipment type
      for which you have requested training.  They go to an individual
      user.</p>

      <p> You can use the site controls in your profile to select whether
      you get email, notifications, or both.</p></dd>
      
  <dt> Announcements </dt>

  <dd> can be made by anyone qualified on the "announcements"
      equipment.  They go to everyone in Makespace.</p>
