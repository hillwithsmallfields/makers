<p>Notifications are sent by the system as an effect of an action,
rather than being sent in their own right by a person (they are not an
internal email system between people).  Their main use is to let you
know when training becomes available for an equipment type for which
you have requested training.  They go to an individual user.</p>

<p>You can use the site controls in your profile to select whether you
get email, notifications, or both.</p></dd>
