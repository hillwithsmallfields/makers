<p>The dietary avoidances section is used when preparing for an event
at which food will be provided.  The event hosts' view of the event
page will show counts for all the combinations of dietary avoidances
of people who have signed up for the meeting.  The choices of
individuals will not be shown.</p>

<p>If you don't indicate what you don't eat, you are at risk of being
counted in for peperoni pizza or similar.</p>

<p class="privacy_warning">Although the choices of individuals will
not be shown, if you are the only attendee, it may be possible to
deduce them, and as some dietary avoidances link to religious
observance, and that is something for which people are sometimes
persecuted, this should be regarded as a possibly sensitive issue for
privacy.</p>
