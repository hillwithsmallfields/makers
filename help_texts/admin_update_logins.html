<p>Importing users from a CSV file only makes the mongodb entries for
them, and doesn't create a django user that can log in (because the
importer is run outside the django environment).  For the latter, you
should use the "Update django logins" button.  This will check all
mongodb user entries for missing django user entries, and create up to
48 missing entries, and send them password reset emails.  (It doesn't
try to do them all, only 48 of them, because doing something for all
users risks taking too long, and having the web framework time out on
the action.)</p>
