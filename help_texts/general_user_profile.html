<p>This general profile section is held in the "profiles" database,
which is where all your "Personally identifying data" is kept; you are
entitled to ask for this to be deleted,
under the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, although you
probably can't continue to be a member in that case.</p>

<p>The <code>link-id</code> links the user record that django uses to
let you log in, with your record in the "profiles" database and any
references to you (which are otherwise anonymous) in the operational
database (where the training qualifications are kept, in the form of
the training event history).  If you leave and ask us to delete your
personally identifying data, you may be able to use your link-id to
get your training history back if you later re-join us (although if
you leave and aren't absolutely sure you will never return, it's
better to ask us to suspend your membership until further notice and
not delete your personally identifying data).</p>
