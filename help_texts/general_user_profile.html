<p>This general profile section is held in the "profiles" database,
which is where all your "Personally identifying data" is kept; you are
entitled to ask for this to be deleted, under the GDPR, although you
can't continue to be a member in that case.</p>

<p>The <code>link-id</code> links the user record that django uses to
let you log in, with your record in the "profiles" database and any
references to you (which are otherwise anonymous) in the operational
database (where the training qualifications are kept, in the form of
training event qualifications).  If you leave and ask us to delete
your personally identifying data, you can use your link-id to get your
training history back if you later re-join us.</p>
