<p>This timeslots table is used when a trainer schedules a training
session, so that invitations can be sent to those who have requested
training and are available at that time.</p>

<p>We recommend you mark as available slots when you may be available,
and only mark as unavailable the slots when you are never available
(i.e. clashes with a regular booked activity, such as your day job,
sports club training, etc).</p>

<p class="privacy_warning">Later versions of the "Makers" system may
display a count of how many training requesters are available at each
timeslot, to the trainers when they are looking for a time at which to
offer training.  If you are the only requester, this will effectively
make your availability data visible.</p>
