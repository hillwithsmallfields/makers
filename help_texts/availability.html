<p>This timeslots table is used when a trainer schedules a training
session, so that invitations can be sent to those who have requested
training and are available at that time.</p>

<p>We recommend you mark as available slots when you may sometimes be available,
and only mark as unavailable the slots when you are never available
(i.e. clashes with a regular booked activity, such as your day job,
sports club training, etc).  If you get a training offer at a time of week
when you're sometimes available but aren't on this occasion, you can
just decline it.</p>

<p>The times are as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Morning:</dt>
      <dd>From %(morning_start)s to %(morning_end)s</dd>
  <dt>Afternoon:</dt>
      <dd>From %(afternoon_start)s to %(afternoon_end)s</dd>
  <dt>Evening:</dt>
      <dd>From %(evening_start)s to %(evening_end)s</dd>
  <dt>Other:</dt>
      <dd>Any other time</dd>
</dl>

<p>Later versions of the system may be able to access cloud calendar
systems through their APIs (subject to you giving details and
permission) to make a more specific check on whether you are
available.  It's a do-ocracy; if you'd really like this feature, feel
welcome to write and contribute it.</p>

<p class="privacy_warning">The "Makers" system displays a count of how
many training requesters are available at each timeslot, to the
trainers when they are looking for a time at which to offer training.
If you are the only requester, this will effectively make your
availability data visible.</p>
